# picturesbylocation

University of Washington continuing education, Javascript Certification:
Develop Dynamic Front- and Back-End Applications

For the second quarter we were required to complete a project where we exercise all the skills we had learned during the quarter.
I chose to hook up two APIs that I really liked. I combined the Flickr and Leaflet API to create an app where you can query pictures 
by clicking on a location on a map.
